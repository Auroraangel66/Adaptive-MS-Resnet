# Adaptive-MS-Resnet
Adaptive multi-scale neural network with Resnet blocks for solving partial differential equations


## About the code
* The code in this repository was written by 'python 3.6' and [Tensorflow1](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
* One should keep it in mind that the parameters provided in this code may not efficiently work for different types of problems. So one may need readjust parameters when use this code for solving different problems.
